    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My top three goals for the class are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Gain experience in web design</li>
    <li>Learn about more programming languages</li>
    <li>Use my graphic design experience</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/> Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
    </p>

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
